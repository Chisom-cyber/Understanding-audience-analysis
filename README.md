# Understanding your audience in technical writing

Knowing what topic to write about and crafting a well-detailed document is important, but knowing who you are writing for is twice as important. In technical writing, it is often emphasized that the true value of any document is in its ability to address and resolve pertinent issues.
However, this usefulness can only be realized if the content proves relevant and accessible to its intended audience. Hence, the need for audience analysis. This article will throw light on what audience analysis is, the importance of analyzing audience, tools and best practices in audience analysis, among other things.

## What is Audience analysis?
Anyone that picks interest or finds your content useful is said to be your audience. However, a target audience is a set of persons for whom the idea behind the content was generated in the first place.

The target audience can vary from being highly **technical**, such as developers or subject matter experts (SMEs), to **non-technical** individuals, like executives or end-users who rely on user manuals to understand and maximize the usage of products.

Audience analysis, therefore, involves the steps that allow a writer to meet the needs and expectations of any user of a content, especially if the content was meant for them.

## Importance of audience analysis

> Audience analysis is perhaps the single most important aspect of technical writing. - Rhoda Israelov

- Is audience analysis worthy of any note?

- Why would anyone do audience analysis?

These are the questions this section will answer.

As a technical writer, you are not writing for self, it is therefore important to consider the needs of your intended users. 
Audience analysis is encouraged for the following reasons:

- **To communicate effectively:**
Effective communication is not complete until the recipient has received the purpose and idea of the message. In the same way, a technical document must be tailored to meet the needs, preferences, and level of understanding of the users to fulfill its purpose. 
By analyzing the audience, a writer can communicate in a way that the target audience understands.

- **To increase the relevance of the document:** Through audience analysis, a writer can produce topics that pique the interest of target users, increase their concentration span, and eventually, the value of the document.

- **To build trust and credibility:** Crafting content that aligns with the interests and understanding of the audience creates an illusion of empathy and professionalism. This increases trust and accessibility to a wider audience.
- **To improve product development:** Audience analysis helps capture behaviors, needs, and preferences of potential users. This can help in product design and also inform better marketing strategies.

## Tools to understand your audience
- **Questionnaires and Surveys**

- **Interviews and focus group discussion**

- **Analytical tools like Google Analytics**

## How to analyse your audience?

1. **Employ the right tools:** This may include the use of interviews

2. **Ask necessary questions:** Ask probing questions that can provide answers to your relevant concerns. According to [Molly Carter](https://www.writingassist.com/resources/articles-3/why-audience-analysis-is-essential-in-technical-writing/), questions like the following can give a quick view of the true identity of the potential users:

> Who is the audience?\
> What do they need?\
> Where do they read?\
> When will they read?\
> Why will they read?\
> How will they use the information?

3. **Gather available information:** Collate the information available, and categorize the responses to the queries

4. **Define your audience:**
Take notes of their goals, needs, interest, demographic information, cultural beliefs, and communication preferences 

5. **Create a persona:** Represent your audience as fictional characters and assign names, needs, interests, hobbies, locations, motivations, and other details that can help you interact with the character as an individual.

## Best practices in audience analysis

- Choose the right tone and style
- Select appropriate language and terminology
- Keep just enough information. Do not overwhelm the audience 
- Emphasize key points. Employ formatting where necessary 
- Employ ethical considerations. Do not infringe on the audience privacy or manipulate their decision

## Conclusion

Audience analysis is an integral step in technical documentation. It is therefore not a good practice for a writer to ignore the primary purpose of documentation by writing a document without anyone in mind. A thorough understanding of the audience is required for a technical document to serve its purpose.\
Learning to implement audience analysis in all the phases of the writing process may increase the value of technical documents.
